<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>


<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with
particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's
point of view. This first course concentrates mostly on the idea of
abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to
the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the
computer hardware. The next course, CS 61B, will deal with the more
advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and
analyzing large programs. Finally, CS 61C concentrates on machines and
how they carry out the programs you write.</p>

<p>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not
about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a
series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as
functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented
programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very
useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our
hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will
find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days'
work.</p>

<p>There is also a self-paced version of this course, <a href="cs61as.html">CS 61AS</a>, which
fulfills the same requirements.</p>


<h3 id="course-format">Course Format</h3>


<p>The course includes many events: lecture, lab, discussion, office hours,
guerrilla sections, homework parties, and review sessions. Weekly lab
and discussion sections are typically the most valuable events to attend. For
the rest, your attendance is optional. These events exist to help you learn,
and so you are advised to attend as many as required to master the material.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture:</strong> The course includes three 50-minute lectures per week. Lecture
videos are distributed online before each live lecture. Most students prefer
the videos, but some prefer the live lecture experience. You are welcome to
view the content either way, but watching videos and then attending live
lecture will be highly redundant.</p>

<p>Links to video lectures will appear on the course website. Screencasts of the
live lecture will be published approximately 36 hours after each event, and
links will also appear on the course website.</p>

<p>The first few live lectures will be repeated twice: once at the regularly
scheduled time and again at 7pm on the same day in 1 Pimentel. As soon as
attendance in live lecture reduces to a number that will fit in the regularly
scheduled lecture hall, evening lectures will end.</p>

<p><strong>Lab and Discussion Sections:</strong> The course includes one laboratory section and
one discussion section each week. These sections are run by an amazing group of
Teaching Assistants who have been carefully selected for their ability,
enthusiasm, and dedication to learning. Getting to know your TA is an excellent
way to succeed in this course.</p>

<p>If you wish to switch sections, simply talk to the TA of the section you wish
to join. You do not need to update your section on Bear Facts. Priority will be
given to people who are officially enrolled in a section, but we will all do
our best to accommodate your wishes.</p>

<p>It's best to find a permanent section as soon as you can and in the first few
weeks. Course projects are completed in pairs. We strongly encourage you to
find a partner in your own section. Your TA will help you.</p>

<p>Participation in lab and discussion is tracked but not required. See the
section on grading for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Attending office hours is another excellent way to succeed in
this course. Office hours are held by TAs and the instructor each week. A
schedule appears on the staff page of the course website.</p>

<p>In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on
assignments, work with peers and course staff in a small group setting, find
project partners, and learn about computer science at Berkeley.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Sections:</strong> In addition to the weekly class meetings, the course
includes many optional events that are designed to help you master the course
material and complete the assignments. Details of these events will be
announced as they approach.</p>


<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>


<p>The online textbook for the course is <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>, which was
created specifically for this course. Readings for each lecture appear in the
course schedule. We recommend that you complete the readings before watching
the lecture videos or attending live lecture.</p>

<p>In addition, the course website links to all guides, handouts, and practice
materials available for the course.</p>


<h3 id="programming-language">Programming Language</h3>


<p>61A uses the Python 3 programming language.  Python is a popular
language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly
well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course.
It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community
that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors.</p>

<p>In previous semesters, this course was taught using the Scheme
language, a dialect of Lisp, which is the oldest programming language
that is still recruiting new users today. Lisp and Python are similar
in many ways. In fact, Lisp popularized many of the features that make
Python a great language. Our choice to change languages is primarily
motivated by the strength of Python's programming community, which you
will soon join as you learn the language.  Python also has excellent
library support for a vast range of application areas.  Knowing Python
will help you pursue your future programming interests, wherever they
may lead you.</p>


<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>


<p>Math 1A is a corequisite for 61A. (That is, it may be taken concurrently.)</p>

<p>There is no formal programming-related prerequisites for admission to 61A. Many
61A students have had significant prior programming experience, but many do
not.  However, students without prior experience typically spend a large amount
of time each week on the course. There is no need for you to be familiar with
any particular programming language.</p>

<p>If you don't feel ready for 61A, we recommend that you take <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/">CS 10: The
Beauty and Joy of Computing</a>, which is an introduction to
computer science for non-majors (and majors needing more programming
experience). The course will teach students how to program using Snap
(based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever
invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves
simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of
smaller blocks.  But the course is far more than just learning to
program! You'll learn some of the "Big Ideas" of computing, such as
abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the
limits of computation. You'll also see some beautiful applications of
computing that have changed the world, as well as talk about the
history of computing and where it will go in the future.</p>

<p>If you have substantial prior programming background, you may feel that you can
skip 61A. In most cases we don't recommend that, but meet with your instructor
to discuss the issue. Although 61A is the first course in the CS sequence, it's
quite different from most introductory courses.  Even students with years of
prior experience are typically not bored in 61A. Prior experience does allow
some students to skip 61B or 61C, which are more comparable to courses taught
elsewhere.</p>


<h3 id="computer-accounts">Computer Accounts</h3>


<p><em>You must</em> have a computer account on the 61A course facility. To set
up an account, you need an account form, which you will receive in the
first lab.</p>

<p>You must set up your account in the first week because that is how we know who
is really in the class. When you log in for the first time, <em>please follow the
instructions carefully.</em> You must have an account in order to submit your first
lab and homework assignment. If you plan to use your personal computer for the
course projects, you must still get a class account to submit assignments.</p>


<h3 id="ask-questions">Ask Questions!</h3>


<p>Your first and most important resource for help in learning the
material in this course is your fellow students. Work closely with your
project partner. You are responsible for helping each other learn.</p>

<p>If you have questions that others might have as well, regarding projects,
homeworks, course policies, etc., post your questions to <a href="http://www.piazza.com/class">Piazza</a>, the course
discussion forum.  Piazza allows you to answer questions from other students.</p>

<p>You should also ask many questions of the course staff, especially during lab
sections and office hours. In addition to instructor and TAs, the course
includes a staff of readers and Lab Assistants (LAs). Each LA will have
scheduled hours to be in the lab. Readers are available periodically to assist
you with your projects. The best way to learn in this course is to attempt all
assignments on your own, but ask questions frequently before you get stuck or
frustrated.</p>

<p>You are welcome to email your instructor or TA directly. Contact information
appears on the staff page of the course website.</p>


<h3 id="computer-resources">Computer Resources</h3>


<p>The computing laboratories in 271, 273, 275, and 277 Soda are our primary lab
rooms, although the CS 61A accounts can also be used from any EECS
Instructional lab in Soda or Cory Hall.  The lab is normally available for use
at all times, but you need a card key for evening access to the lab.</p>

<p><strong>Current UCB students:</strong> If you are enrolled in the course, your Cal student
ID serves as your card key and will automatically be activated for access to
the Soda second floor labs (including entering the building). You do not have
to do anything, unless for some reason it doesn't work, then see below.</p>

<p><strong>Concurrent/other students:</strong> You can fill out an application and obtain a
white card key from 387 Soda Hall (the front desk). There is a small fee for
access.</p>

<p>During scheduled lab sessions, only students enrolled in that
particular section may be in the lab. At other hours, any 61A student
may use the lab on a drop-in basis.</p>

<p>Be respectful of the lab space. Please don't steal the chairs, and definitely
<strong>do not eat or drink in the lab</strong>. Don't unplug anything; unplugged computers
make our hard-working instructional computing team very sad.   If you see
someone disrupting the space, ask them to stop.</p>


<h3 id="projects-and-homeworks">Projects and Homeworks</h3>


<p>Each week there will be problems assigned for you to work on, most of
which will involve writing and debugging programs. These assignments
come in three categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Laboratory exercises</strong> are short, relatively simple exercises
  designed to introduce a new topic. You can complete these during the
  scheduled lab meetings and submit them then.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework assignments</strong> are more involved and are meant to illustrate and
  explore new topics.  Homeworks are generally assigned on Wednesdays and due
  the following Wednesdsay at 11:59pm. You are encouraged to discuss the
  homework with other students, but your final solution should be developed
  either alone or with one partner.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong> are larger assignments intended to teach you how to
  combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. There are four
  projects during the semester.  You are encouraged to complete
  projects in pairs; your partner should be another student in your
  section. (Working alone or with someone from another section is allowed, but
  not a good idea.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the homework is for you to learn the course material,
not to prove that you already know it. Therefore, the weekly homeworks
are not graded on the correctness of your solutions, but on effort. You
will get full credit for an entirely wrong answer that shows reasonable
effort!</p>

<p>Each homework is worth two points for a reasonable effort, zero points
for a missing homework or one that seems to show no effort, or negative
ten (-10) points for a solution copied from someone else. Detecting copied
homeworks is very easy for our computers, so don't try.</p>

<p>The four programming projects are graded on the correctness and clarity
of your solutions.  If you work with a partner (which you should), work
together to ensure that both group members understand the complete
program you create.</p>


<h3 id="tests-and-grading">Tests and Grading</h3>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 300
points, with the following distribution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Midterm 1, worth 40 points.</li>
  <li>Midterm 2, worth 50 points.</li>
  <li>The final exam, worth 80 points.</li>
  <li>Take-home programming quizzes, worth 10 points.</li>
  <li>Four projects, worth a total of 90 points</li>
  <li>Homework, worth a total of 30 points</li>
</ul>

<p>Midterms are held in the evenings from 7pm-9pm to give you more time to
complete them than lecture would allow. You will be allowed to bring a
fixed number of pages of notes to each exam. Details of this policy
will be released as the exam approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Midterms will be held on Monday 9/22 and 10/27!</strong> If you are not
available from 7pm to 9pm on those days, you will fill out a survey near the
time of the exam.</p>

<p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores:</p>

<pre><code>A+  293+        A  280-292     A-  270-279
B+  255-269     B  232-254     B-  220-231
C+  212-219     C  202-211     C-  190-201
D+  180-189     D  170-179     D-  160-169</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this scale is nonlinear; the steps are wider in the B range.
In a typical semester, about 75% of students receive A's and B's.</p>

<p>This grading formula implies that <em>there is no curve</em>; your grade will
depend only on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else does.</p>

<p>Incomplete grades will be granted only for dire medical or personal
emergencies that cause you to miss the final, and only if your work up
to that point has been satisfactory.</p>

<p><strong>Lab/Discussion Participation</strong> Completing and submitting lab assignments, as
well as attending and participating in discussion sections, will allow you to
earn back lost points on your midterms. Therefore, participation is not
required, but it is tracked and potentially beneficial. Details of this policy
will be released shortly.</p>


<h3 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h3>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams and take-home quizzes, we encourage you to
discuss <em>all</em> of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you
are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work
with others than if you do not.  Ask questions, answer questions, and share
ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and TA
informed.  If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently!  You should inform your project partner,
so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>


<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in 61A that limit is code. Feel free to
discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the code that solves them.
Homework and projects can be completed in pairs. You can share everything with
your partner. Do not share your code with anyone but your partner, and do not
read anyone but your partner's code.  Write your own programs and keep them to
yourself.</p>

<p>I expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your
own projects.  The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you
learn, which is why you're here. The course staff works hard to put together
this course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of the course
by not misrepresenting your work.</p>

<p>The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, "Copying all or part of
another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed,
are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated." The policy statement goes on
to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the
test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help.  You are not alone in
this course!  The TAs, lab assistants, and instructor are all here to help you
succeed.  If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the
projects, you won't need to copy any answers.</p>


<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>


<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact your TA and partner as
early as possible. Late project submission requires approval by your TA.
Typically, projects will be accepted up to 24 hours after the deadline, but
late projects will only receive 2/3 of the earned score. No credit will be
given for late homework or for projects turned in more than one day late.
Exceptions may be made for <em>extraordinary</em> circumstances.</p>


<h3 id="early-policy">Early Policy</h3>


<p>On each project, you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p>


<h3 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h3>


<p>This document shouldn't end with a list of late penalties, because penalties
and grades aren't the purpose of the course. We actually just want you to
learn.  We're very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic group of
students this semester.  We want all of you to be successful here.  Welcome to
61A.</p>
