<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Sublime is a friendly text editor known for its slick user interface,
numerous features, and snappy performance that provides a combination
of many amazing features from modern text editors (and more)!</p>

<p>Sublime is easy to use, and extremely fun to master (I mean, who
doesn't want to use multiple cursors in vim mode while — you get the
picture, do things with CS words that don't quite make sense right
now). This guide will get you started with Sublime, with a few basics
and essential tools for your workflow in CS61A. If there's something
you want Sublime to do, it's likely possible! A quick Google search
will probably show you a plugin you can install to extend Sublime's
functionality.</p>


<h2 id="getting-sublime-on-your-own-computer">Getting Sublime on your own computer</h2>


<p>You can go to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime's website</a> to
download it.</p>


<h2 id="example-greet-py">Example: <code>greet.py</code></h2>


<p>Alright, by now, you should have Sublime installed. You have the option
of either finding the Application or opening it up from the terminal.
Recall from <a href="../lab00/">Lab 0</a> that you can open a terminal on the school
computers by pressing <code>Ctrl-Alt-t</code>.</p>

<p>Let's first create and navigate to a directory called <code>example</code>, using
the UNIX commands you learned in <a href="../lab00/">Lab 0</a>:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/example
cd ~/example</code></pre>


<h3 id="opening-files">Opening files</h3>


<p>Now let's open up Sublime!</p>

<blockquote class="help-mac">

<p>For Ubuntu or Mac users, you'll most likely find Sublime in your
<code>Applications</code>.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>For Windows users, you'll most likely find Sublime in your
<code>Program Files</code>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sublime will open up to a blank file. We can start writing our program!</p>

<h3 id="editing-files">Editing files</h3>


<p>Now we have Sublime open, we can begin writing our first Python file.
Don't worry, we don't expect you to know any Python yet! All
you have to do is type in the following:</p>

<pre><code>def greet(name):
    print('Hi', name, ', how are you doing?')
    print(' - Python')</code></pre>

<p>Once you've finished typing, Sublime should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/greet-function.png" alt="Greet function"></p>

<p>To save, you can just type <code>Ctrl + s</code>. If you haven't already, save
this file as <code>greet.py</code>.</p>


<h3 id="running-python">Running Python</h3>


<p>In this class, you will be switching between your text editor and
Python a lot — writing code and testing code.</p>

<p>Back in our terminal, we're currently in our <code>example</code> directory.
Let's play around with our code. In the terminal, start by typing</p>

<pre><code>python3 -i greet.py</code></pre>

<p>This command does the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>python3</code> is the command that starts Python</li>
  <li>The <code>-i</code> flag tells Python to start in <strong>interactive mode</strong>, which
  allows you to type in Python commands from your terminal</li>
  <li><code>greet.py</code> is the name of the Python file we want to load</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice that the Python interpreter says <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. This means Python is
ready to take a command.</p>

<p>Recall that we defined a function called <code>greet</code>. Let's see what it
does! Type in the following:</p>

<pre><code>greet('Michelle')</code></pre>

<p>Python will then print out</p>

<pre><code>Hi Michelle, how are you doing?
 - Python</code></pre>

<p>You probably want Python to greet you and not me. So if your name is
John, you should also type:</p>

<pre><code>greet('John')</code></pre>

<p>and Python will print</p>

<pre><code>Hi John, how are you doing?
 - Python</code></pre>

<p>Our code works! Let's close Python by typing in</p>

<pre><code>exit()</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>There are a couple of ways to exit Python. You can type in <code>exit()</code>
or <code>quit()</code>. On MacOS and Linux, you can also type in <code>Ctrl-d</code> (this
doesn't work on Windows).</p></blockquote>

<p>Congratulations, you've edited your first file in Sublime!</p>


<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>


<p>Sublime has a some swell keyboard shortcuts. Here are a few useful
ones!  (for Mac users, replace all the <code>Ctrl</code> sequences with <code>cmd</code>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ctrl+s</code> : saves the current file</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+x</code> : cuts the entire line your cursor is on</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+v</code> : pastes the entire line you cut in the line above your
  curson OR pastes the selected text in place</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+d</code> (my favorite!): highlights the current word. For every
  'ctrl+d' you type after this first word, it will highlight every next
  instance of the word. This allows you to easily rename variables with
  multiple cursors! (Play around with this one, it's fun!)</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+z</code> : undo</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+y</code> : redo</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+tab</code> : moves you to the next tab</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+shift+tab</code> : moves you to the previous tab</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+f</code> : search for a word</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+shift+f</code> : searches through all tabs</li>
  <li><code>ctrl+shift+p</code> : This one's important. This opens up a little panel
  of tools! You can do things like type "ss python" which will set the
  syntax of your file to python or "reindent" will help you reindent a
  file you paste in (this will be helpful in future labs!)</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide only scratches the surface of all of Sublime's
functionality. Remember, if there's something you wish Sublime could
do, it probably can! Just Google it!</p>
