<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Today, we will build a text-based adventure game. This involves
writing a program that accepts text commands, interprets those
commands, acts upon them, and reports the results back to the player.
For example, the game will look like:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 adventure.py

Welcome to the micro-world of CS 61A! You have a midterm tomorrow,
and in hopes of doing well, you quest to seek Werdna, a mythical
TA who is rumoured to hold the key to besting the test.

You arrive in 271 Soda. The room is bright
and miserable as always. A few 61A students
are scattered among the lab computers, working
on the latest project.
Exits:
out - Hearst Ave.

adventure&gt; help
There are 7 possible operators
look
go
take
give
examine
ask
help

adventure&gt; look

You look around. You see
A rubber ducky

adventure&gt; take rubber ducky
You take the rubber ducky

adventure&gt; examine rubber ducky

Hm. It's yellow and it's rubber and it squeaks. Fascinating.

adventure&gt; go out

You leave 2nd floor Soda though the exit all the cool kids use
You find yourself on the sidewalk of Hearst Ave.
Exits:
north - 271 Soda
west - Euclid Ave.
south - Campus</code></pre>

<p>At a high level, this is exactly what an interpeter does.</p>

<p>Why are we doing this? Because traditionally, all the interpreter based
exercises in 61A have either been "write a calculator" OR "write an
programming language interpreter." Hopefully this livens things up.</p>

<h2 id="interpreters">Interpreters</h2>


<p>An interpreter is a program that allows you to interact
with the computer in a certain language. It understands the
expressions that you type in through that language, and perform
the corresponding actions in some way, usually using an underlying
language.</p>

<p>For example, you saw a simple calculator language in lecture that is
written in Python.  In Project 4, you will write a Scheme interpreter
in Python as well. Python itself is written in the C programming
language.  The computer itself uses hardware to interpret machine code,
a series of ones and zeros that represent basic operations like adding
numbers, loading information from memory, etc.</p>

<p>When you talk about an interpreter, there are two languages that
are at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The language being interpreted. We also call this the language being
  implemented. We use Python to implement calc and Scheme. The main 
  Python distribution (known as CPython) is implemented in C.</li>
  <li>The underlying implementation language. From above, Python, Python,
  and C respectively.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the underlying language need not be different from the implemented
language. In the previous incarnation of 61A, students were introduced to a
Scheme interpreter written in Scheme. CS61A in Summer 2012 covered a Python
interpreter written in Python!  This idea is called Metacircular Evaluation.</p>

<p>Each interpreter has five parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lexer - first operation called by REPL. The lexer turns the user input string
  into atomic pieces (tokens) that are like "words" of the implemented language. 
  In Adventure, this part is combined with the parser in <code>adv_parse</code> in the line
  <code>tokens = line.split()</code>.</li>
  <li>Parser - takes the tokens and organizes them in a data structure that
  the underlying language understands. For our adventure game, holding the
  tokens in a tuple is enough. For Scheme, we use deep linked lists (linked
  lists whose elements can also be linked lists) to represent hierarchy and
  recursion.</li>
  <li>Evaluator - takes in the aforementioned sequence and interprets it
  accordingly to the rules of the language. The evaluator may call
  apply to apply an evaluated operator to its evaluated operands.</li>
  <li>Apply - applies the operator to the argument values. Apply may call
  the evaluator to do more work... this is possibly the most important
  example of Mutual Recursion. Ever.</li>
  <li>Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL for short) - the loop that waits for user
  input, passes it to the parser and then the evaluator, and then
  prints out the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's how all the pieces fit together:</p>

<pre><code>              ____________________________________________
              |                                            |
              |_____     _________     __________    ______|
User Input --&gt;|Lexer|--&gt; | Parser |--&gt; |Evaluator|--&gt;|Print|--&gt; Output
              |_____|    |________|    |_________|   |_____|
              |                        __^_v____           |
              ^                       |Apply    |          v
              ^ REPL                  |_________|          v
              |____________________________________________|</code></pre>

<p>Now let's explore how these parts work together in an
adventure game!</p>


<h2 id="adventure">Adventure</h2>


<p>We can implement our adventure language in Python3 by completing
the interpreter(/game engine) in <code>adventure.py</code>.</p>

<p>First, here's an explanation of the the two files we were given:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>adventure.py</code>: This file includes the skeleton code of the game
  engine that you will complete. There are also classes (Person, Place,
  Thing) that model objects in the game. Your engine and the game data
  uses these.</li>
  <li><code>cs61a_world.py</code>: All the game data that makes things interesting is
  in this file.  It creates Persons, Places, and Things that make up
  the adventure world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's look at the base code in <code>adventure.py</code>.  There's a lot of
code to take in at once, but don't freeze up!  We'll walk through and
implement everything, function by function.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>adventure</code>: our REPL. This function reads player input, calls
  <code>adv_parse</code> to get an expression out (represented as a tuple), and
  then calls <code>adv_eval</code> to perform the actions. It prints the results
  accordingly. Then it makes a recursive call to itself in order to
  take in the next command.</li>
</ul>

<p>The player is represented as a <code>Person</code> object. The interpreter will
allow the player to move the <code>Person</code> through the game and interact
with the various aspects of the world.</p>

<p>You can try to run it by doing</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; python3 adventure.py</code></pre>

<p>However it's missing functionality, so nothing will really work.</p>

<p>Let's fix that, shall we?</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: When you want to test manually, make sure you're in Python.
Here's how:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 -i adventure.py
adventure&gt;                 # Type ctrl-D
&gt;&gt;&gt; adv_parse('look')      # Now you can call adv_parse</code></pre>

<p>Remember that when you run <code>adventure.py</code>, you are talking to
the adventure program, which will evaluate your input in terms
of the adventure code. In order to talk to Python again, you
kill the adventure program by doing Ctrl-d.</p>

<p>If the above didn't work (Ctrl-d takes you out of the entire
interpreter), try</p>

<pre><code>$ python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; from adventure import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from cs61a_world import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; adv_parse('look')</code></pre>

<p>OK tests can still be run the same way</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 ok -q adv_parse</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Let's start things off by implementing parsing. We do this in
<code>adv_parse</code> â€” our Parser. Since our game language is simple, we're
going to do the lexical (turn line into tokens) and syntactic analyses
(turn tokens into expression) all in one function. Our expression
representation is a tuple (No ADT here). Here is the basic syntax of a
command:</p>

<pre><code>[operator] [operand]</code></pre>

<p>When we encounter a command that matches this syntax, return:</p>

<pre><code>([operator], [operand])</code></pre>

<p>Another common syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>[operator]</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding expression is:</p>

<pre><code>([operator], '')</code></pre>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><code>adv_parse('take cookie')</code> returns <code>('take', 'cookie')</code></p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>'take'</code> is the operator</li>
    <li><code>'cookie'</code> is the operand</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><code>adv_parse('look')</code> returns <code>('look', '')</code></p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>'look'</code> is the operator</li>
    <li><code>''</code> is the operand</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><code>adv_parse('take rubber ducky')</code> returns <code>('take', 'rubber ducky')</code></p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>'take'</code> is the operator</li>
    <li><code>'rubber ducky'</code> is the operand</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of our operators follow this syntax.  There are two commands that
require a different handling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><code>ask</code>: when you encounter a line like 'ask Leonard for sushi', return
  <code>('ask', 'Leonard', 'sushi')</code></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The recipient will always be immediately after 'ask', with 'for' afterward.</li>
    <li>You can assume that the name is only one word long.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><code>give</code>: when you encounter a line like 'give a cookie to Andrew',
  return <code>('give', 'a cookie', 'Andrew')</code></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The recipient will always be last, with 'to' beforehand.</li>
    <li>You can assume that the name is only one word long and 'to' appears second to last.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Use OK to test your solution to <code>adv_parse</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q adv_parse</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'take rubber ducky'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = x.split()
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
['take', 'rubber', 'ducky']
&gt;&gt;&gt; y.pop(0)
'take'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
['rubber', 'ducky']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join(y[0:]) # Google 'python3 string join'
'rubber ducky'
&gt;&gt;&gt; # You may also find list slicing helpful</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: This lab is heavy on the concepts, so the big picture is important. 
We therefore tried to make the code simpler to write to help with that.
We suggest that you actively discuss the interpretation process and how Scheme's
additional features (e.g. <code>define</code>) might change the way we write certain parts of the
interpreter.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p><code>adv_eval</code>: our Evaluator. We want to handle all kinds of expressions.</p>

<p>The rules are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For normal expressions: evaluate the OPERATOR and evaluate each OPERAND.
  <em>Hint</em>: Which function in <code>adventure.py</code> can we use to evaluate them?
  Then, apply the operator to the operand by calling <code>adv_apply</code>.</li>
  <li>For give expressions: handle them using the <code>give</code> function (line
  109). You may just call the <code>give</code> function directly in this case.
  What is <code>give</code>'s domain?</li>
  <li>For ask expressions: handle them using the <code>ask</code> function (line
  122). What is <code>ask</code>'s domain?</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from adventure import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from cs61a_world import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; adv_parse('look')
&gt;&gt;&gt; Place.current = SodaHall
&gt;&gt;&gt; adv_eval(adv_parse('take rubber ducky'))
'Player 1 takes the rubber ducky'
&gt;&gt;&gt; Place.current = WerdnasHouse
&gt;&gt;&gt; adv_eval(adv_parse('give rubber ducky to Werdna'))
'Werdna takes the rubber ducky'</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: You won't be able to test this until you finish Question 3.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>adv_eval</code> is truly where the action is. It takes the expression
that is passed in and performs the correct action based on the rules
of our game language.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Use recursion and also the functions defined right under <code>adv_eval</code>
(<code>adv_apply</code>, <code>look</code>, <code>give</code>, <code>take</code>, etc.).</p>

<p><code>ask</code> and <code>give</code> are Special Forms, because they do not follow the 
<code>[operator] [operand]</code> pattern. As you can see, we write separate rules for
them in <code>adv_eval</code> to account for this difference. When evaluating Scheme
expressions, you will also have to handle <code>if</code>, <code>define</code>, and other forms
differently because not all operands are evaluated in those expressions.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3</h3>

<p><code>adv_apply</code>: our apply. Handles the application of the normal commands
Since our commands are simple, <code>adv_apply</code> just needs to apply the
operator to the operand. There are no calls to <code>adv_eval</code> in Adventure.</p>

<p>The point of apply becomes more apparent with more complicated
languages. (Why? Which features of programming languages are missing in
this adventure game language?)
However the princple holdsâ€”apply takes care of the
function calls that are evaluated without any special rules.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: <code>adv_apply</code> is really straightfoward. Don't overthink it.</p>

<p>Use OK to test your solution to <code>adv_eval</code> and <code>adv_apply</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q adv_eval</code></pre>

<p>AT THIS POINT YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME! :D</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Question 4</h3>

<p>One thing that would be useful is to figure out what's in our
inventory. For example:</p>

<pre><code>adventure&gt; take rubber ducky
Player 1 takes the rubber ducky
adventure&gt; stuff
You look through your stuff... you see
rubber ducky - Hm. It's yellow and it's rubber and it squeaks. Fascinating.
-- End of stuff --</code></pre>

<p>Add code to take care of this. What needs to be modified?
Do <code>adv_eval</code> and/or <code>adv_apply</code> need to be modified at all?</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: You will find it helpful to use <code>examine</code> (line 133).</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q5">Question 5</h3>

<p>Now that you've implemented this interpreter, you can play the game!</p>

<pre><code>python3 adventure.py</code></pre>

<p>Happy Questing!</p>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>Hope this lab was fun. :)</p>

<p>Since the game is simple, some parts of the lab are toy-ish.
However, the game is still strong and robust enough to be extended;
feel free to add more places, people and things! :P
This also speaks to how powerful Python is as a language,
to allow us to create a full game in relatively short time!
(The original TA might have hacked this game together in a night...)
You are also encouraged to create your own world and tell your own story.</p>

<p>Lab 10 Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpreters allow us to directly interact with the computer through
  a language.</li>
  <li>Interpreters are made of a REPL, a parser, an evaluator, and an
  apply'er. They interact with each other in specific ways.</li>
  <li>There are two languages when talking about an interpreter: the
  underlying language vs language being implemented.</li>
  <li>Special forms have their own rules for being evaluted.  They don't
  get handled in apply.</li>
  <li>In adventure.py, the adventure game language is interpreted by the
  Python program. You talk to the computer in adventure talk which gets
  translated to actions in the underlying Python language.</li>
  <li>No tree recursion between <code>adv_eval</code> and <code>adv_apply</code>: our simple game
  language doesn't need it. However, think about what why mutual recursion
  is necessary in Scheme.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Project 4, you will implement a Scheme interpreter in Python.</p>
