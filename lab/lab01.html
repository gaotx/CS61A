<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p><a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">Lab 0</a> walked you through how to use the school computers for CS
61A. This lab explains how to use your own computer to complete
assignments!</p>


<h3 id="finding-a-text-editor">Finding a text editor</h3>


<p>First, we need to find a good text editor. A text editor is like
Microsoft Word — a program that allows you to write in one or more
languages. You will be using a text editor to create, modify, and save
files.</p>

<p>There are many editors out there, each with its own set of features.
You can choose your own editor, but for the purpose of this class, your
text editor must</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an easy way to open and edit new files</li>
  <li>Work well with Python files and plain text in general</li>
  <li>Have line numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, almost all useful editors have</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the text editors that we recommend. We've written short guides
for each one to get you started:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../sublime/">Sublime Text</a> (a popular choice among students)</li>
  <li><a href="../emacs/">Emacs</a></li>
  <li><a href="../vim/">Vim</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each guide has a section on installing the text editor to your personal
computer. For the sake of this lab, you can just jump to there.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please, please, <em>please</em> do not use Microsoft Word to edit
programs. Word is designed to edit natural languages like English —
trouble will ensue if you try to write Python with Word!</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Python usually comes with a text editor called IDLE. We
<strong>do not</strong> recommend it because you won't gain as much experience
using the command line to run your Python programs. This is very
important once you start working on the projects for this class so we
highly recommend that you use the command line to run your files from
day 1!</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="installing-python">Installing Python</h3>


<p>In addition to text editors, which let you <em>write</em> Python code, you
will need to install the <strong>Python interpreter</strong>, which allows you to
<em>run</em> Python code.</p>

<p>You can get Python <a href="https://www.python.org/download">here</a>. Download
one of the installers (for example, "Windows X86-64 MSI Installer" or
"MacOS X 64-bit ... Installer"). If your computer is a 64-bit machine,
you should download the 64-bit installer. (In general, if your computer
is new within the past 2 years, it is likely 64-bit. Ask a TA or lab
assistant if you're not sure.)</p>

<blockquote class="help-mac">

<p>MacOS users can refer to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHuBHxJdK8">video</a> for additional
help on setting up Python.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>Windows users can refer to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w">video</a> for additional
help on setting up Python (up to 1:09 into the video).</p>

<p>You will also need to configure your <code>PATH</code>; the same
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w#t=300">video</a> describes
how to do this from 3:00 to 5:54.</p>

</blockquote>


<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>


<p>First, open up a terminal.</p>

<blockquote class="help-mac">

<p>If you're on a Mac or are using a form of Linux (such as Ubuntu), you
already have a program called <code>Terminal</code> on your computer.  Open that
up and you should be good to go.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>For Windows users, you have several options. We recommend downloading a
program called <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">GitBash</a>, which behaves
like a UNIX terminal.<sup><a href="#fnref-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the video in the previous section uses a built-in terminal
called <code>cmd</code> — this is not the same as GitBash.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Once you have your terminal open, we'll use what we learned from <a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">Lab
0</a>: our handy Unix commands!</p>

<p><img src="assets/terminal.png" alt="starting the terminal"></p>

<p>Right now, I'm in my home directory. Recall from <a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">Lab 0</a> that the
home directory is represented by the <code>~</code> symbol (outlined in green
above).</p>

<blockquote><p>Don't worry if your terminal window doesn't look exactly the
same; the important part is that the text on the left hand side is
relatively the same (with a different name) and you should definitely
see a <code>~</code> (tilde).</p></blockquote>

<p>We can use commands like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> just like before. Let's make a
directory called <code>cs61a</code> to store all of the assignments for this
class.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/cs61a</code></pre>

<p>A folder called <code>cs61a</code> will appear in our home directory.  Let's also
add a <code>projects</code>, <code>lab</code>, and a <code>lab01</code> folder inside of our <code>lab</code>
folder.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/cs61a
mkdir projects
mkdir lab
mkdir lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>Now if we list the contents of the directory (using <code>ls</code>), we'll see
two folders, <code>projects</code> and <code>lab</code>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/terminal_commands.png" alt="cs61a directory"></p>


<h3 id="downloading-the-assignment">Downloading the assignment</h3>


<p>Next, download the template file, <a href="lab01.py">lab01.py</a>. Once you've done that,
let's find our downloaded file:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>On most computers, <code>lab01.py</code> is probably located in a directory
  called <code>Downloads</code> in your home directory. Let's use the <code>ls</code>
  command to check:</p>

<pre><code>ls ~/Downloads</code></pre>

  <p>If you don't see <code>lab01.py</code>, ask a TA or lab assistant for help.</p></li>
  <li><p>Let's move our starter file into our new lab directory:</p>

<pre><code>mv ~/Downloads/lab01.py ~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code></pre>

  <p>This command will move the file located at <code>~/Downloads/lab01.py</code> to
  the directory <code>~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, go back into the <code>lab01</code> folder that we made earlier.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>We're ready to start editing a file. Don't worry if this seems
complicated — it will get much easier over time.  Just keep
practicing!</p>


<h2 id="setting-up-a-productive-workflow">Setting up a productive workflow</h2>


<p>Let's start editing some files! For each assignment, we'll
provide you with some starter code (for example, <code>lab01.py</code>); all you
have to do is fill in the parts that are incomplete.</p>

<p>Open <code>lab01.py</code> in your editor of choice. You should see the following
text:</p>

<p><img src="assets/lab01.png" alt="lab01.py in a text editor"></p>

<p>In our productive workflow, we suggest having at least two windows open
at all times.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your text editor with the files you are editing.</li>
  <li>Your terminal window so you can easily run doctests and later on,
  unit tests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a screenshot of a typical workspace. We've got our text editor
on the left and our terminal on the right!</p>

<p><img src="assets/workflow.png" alt="productive workflow"></p>

<blockquote><p>Again, the screenshots in this lab are using Sublime Text 2
on Mac OS X as our text editor; this particular setup might look
different from yours. That's okay!</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="a-first-look-at-lab01-py">A first look at <code>lab01.py</code></h2>


<p>Notice the various blocks of green text that are wrapped within three
quotation marks <code>"""</code>. That text is called a <strong>docstring</strong>, which is a
description of what the function is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Within the docstring, there are lines that begin with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. These
lines are called <strong>doctests</strong>. Doctests are a great way to
explain what the function does by showing actual Python code: "if we
input this Python code (the lines that say <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), what should the
expected output be (the lines underneath the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>)?"</p>

<p>In particular, let's look at the <code>my_email()</code> function:</p>

<p><img src="assets/email.png" alt="<code>my_name</code> function"></p>

<p>The test in our docstring checks that you changed the return value from
the default <code>'oski@berkeley.edu'</code>.</p>

<p>How do we use these tests? Glad you asked!</p>


<h2 id="running-doctests">Running doctests</h2>


<p>To run our doctests, switch over to our terminal and type in the
following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>If you are using Windows and the <code>python3</code> command doesn't work, try
using just <code>python</code> or <code>py</code>. If neither of those work, take another
look at the video in the section on <a href="#installing-python">installing
Python</a> to make sure you are setting up your PATH
correctly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This will print out a lot of output that shows which tests we are
currently failing. You should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/doctests.png" alt="doctest output"></p>

<p>Oh man, we had 2 failures! :( Before we begin fixing our bugs, let's
see what this output says. In particular, look at the <code>my_email</code> test
that we failed:</p>

<p><img src="assets/email_failure.png" alt="my name test failure"></p>

<p>Notice it says we had an error in <code>lab01.py</code> on line 4, in the
function <code>my_email</code>. Now we know exactly where to look for the bug
(this is why line numbers are a must for text editors).</p>

<p>After we find line 4, let's try to understand what the test
is saying: the function <code>my_email</code>, when called with zero inputs,
should <strong>not</strong> return the string <code>'oski@berkeley.edu'</code>. The
problem is, ours is returning that string! Change that to your
berkeley.edu email:</p>

<pre><code>def my_email():
    """Return your last name as a string.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_email() != 'oski@berkeley.edu'
    True
    """
    return 'jane.doe@berkeley.edu'</code></pre>

<p>Once you've changed the return value of the function <code>my_email</code>
(make sure that you're returning a string, which has quotes around it),
try running the doctests again from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>

<p>The test for <code>my_email</code> should pass. One down, one to go!</p>

<p>For the second function, <code>twenty_fourteen</code>, replace the blank line with
an expression that evaluates to the number 2014, using only integers
and the functions <code>add</code> and <code>mul</code>. There are many simple ways to do
this — try to come up with the most creative solution! Make sure your
doctests pass once you're done.</p>

<blockquote><p>You might run your doctests and see that there is no output. This is
actually good — it means all the tests passed. By default, doctests
only print output when you have <strong>failures</strong> in your tests.</p>

<p>However, if you want to double-check that you are passing all of the
tests, you can add a command line flag <code>-v</code> to see <em>all</em> the output,
including the tests that passed:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest -v lab01.py</code></pre>

<p>This is called "verbose" mode.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once all of your tests pass, the verbose output of the doctests
(<code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py -v</code>) should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/passed_tests.png" alt="successful"></p>

guide</a>.</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting assignments</h2>


<p>Now that you have completed your first CS 61A assignment, it's time to
turn it in. There are a couple of steps to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy your assignment file to your class account</li>
  <li>Submit your assignment</li>
  <li>Verify that we have received your assignment</li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p><strong>For Windows users</strong>: Steps 1 and 1.5 below assume you are using Git
Bash as your terminal. If you chose one of the alternative methods in
the footnote<sup><a href="#fnref-1">1</a></sup>, please see the <a href="#windows-no-gitbash">appendix</a> for
help with steps 1 and 1.5.</p>

</blockquote>


<h3 id="step-1">Step 1: Copying your assignment to your class account</h3>


<p>Before you can turn in your assignment, you need to get it onto your
class account first.</p>

<p>From your terminal, Navigate to your directory that contains <code>lab01.py</code>,
if you aren't there already:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>To copy <code>lab01.py</code> to your class account, type in the following command</p>

<pre><code>scp lab01.py cs61a-??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu:~</code></pre>

<p>where <code>??</code> is replaced with your two (or three) letter login.</p>

<blockquote><p>To understand what this command does, let's break it down into three
parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>scp</code> stands for <strong>s</strong>ecure <strong>c</strong>o<strong>p</strong>y. It is used for
  transferring data over a network.</li>
  <li><code>lab01.py</code> is the path to the file(s) that you want to copy.</li>
  <li><p><code>cs61a-??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu:~</code> is the destination. Unlike the
  normal <code>cp</code> command, the destination of the <code>scp</code> command can be a
  location on a remote computer.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>cs61a-??</code> is the username on that remote computer (in this case,
    your class login).</li>
    <li><code>cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code> is the name of the remote computer (also
    known as a <strong>server</strong>). A complete list of servers can be found
    <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/clients.cgi?choice=13&amp;string=">here</a>.</li>
    <li>The <code>:</code> separates the name of the server from the location on
    that server, <code>~</code>. Recall that <code>~</code> stands for the home directory.
    In other words, the destination is the home directory of your
    class account.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>After typing this command, you'll be asked for your password and then
the file will transfer over.</p>


<h3 id="step-1-5-logging-into-your-class-account">Step 1.5: Logging into your class account</h3>


<p>Great, now <code>lab01.py</code> is on the instructional servers. <strong>You're not done
quite yet!</strong> We have to actually submit our files.</p>

<p>To do this, we first have to log into our class account. Type in the
following command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh cs61a-??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code></pre>

<p>where <code>??</code> is replaced with your two (or three) letter login.</p>

<blockquote><p>Again, if you're interested, here's an explanation of what the
command does:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>ssh</code> is a <strong>s</strong>ecure <strong>sh</strong>ell (i.e. terminal) that connects to
  remote servers</li>
  <li><code>cs61a-??</code> is the username on the remote server</li>
  <li><code>cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code> is the name of the remote server. Again, here
  is a list of <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/clients.cgi?choice=13&amp;string=">servers</a> that belong to Berkeley's CS department</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>You can also watch this
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irwlU7esODA">video</a> for help.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, you'll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="assets/ssh.png" alt="inst login"></p>


<h3 id="step-2-submitting-your-assignment">Step 2: Submitting your assignment</h3>


<p>If you copied your files over correctly, you should be able to type
<code>ls</code> and see your <code>lab01.py</code> file. If not, take another look at <a href="#step-1">Step
1</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're really stuck, try posting on Piazza first. If that still
doesn't help, come talk to one of the TAs in office hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>To stay organized, we'll first create a folder on our class account to
hold <code>lab01.py</code>.  In the future, you'll be submitting projects with
multiple files so it's good to get in a habit of creating a new folder
for each assignment. Let's make the <code>lab01</code> directory, move our
<code>lab01.py</code> file into it, and then <code>cd</code> into our <code>lab01</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir lab01
mv lab01.py lab01
cd lab01</code></pre>

<p>We're all ready to submit our assignment. First, run the doctests one
last time to make sure everything is passing:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>For Windows: now that we are logged into our class account, we will be
using <code>python3</code>, not just <code>python</code> or <code>py</code>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Good, the tests pass. But wait, there's more! Recall that, when you
first received your class account, you were asked to enter registration
information. Double check that this information is correct:</p>

<pre><code>check-register</code></pre>

<p>If you find errors (e.g. you typed your last name as "ssh update"), fix
them immediately by running the command:</p>

<pre><code>re-register</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: you don't have to do this every time you submit an
assignment — we just want to make sure it is correct now before it's
too late.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, now we're ready to submit our assignment. From within the <code>lab01</code>
directory, type</p>

<pre><code>submit lab01</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>There will be a "sanity check" that verifies some simple details
about your assignment. For <code>lab01</code>, the sanity check makes sure you
didn't fill in <code>lab01.py</code> incorrectly. For regular assignments, the
sanity check will do other things, like check for syntax errors.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="step-3-verifying-your-submission">Step 3: Verifying your submission</h3>


<p>To check that you successfully submitted, type in</p>

<pre><code>glookup -t</code></pre>

<p><code>glookup</code> is the name of the command that you will use this semester to
check your grades. At any time, you can simply enter <code>glookup</code> to check
your grades. Adding a <code>-t</code> to the <code>glookup</code> command allows you to
see all the times that you have successfully submitted an assignment.
You should see a successful submission of about 1 minute ago.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you just submitted your first CS61A assignment!</p>

<blockquote class="help-windows">


<h2 id="windows-no-gitbash">Appendix: Windows users who aren't using GitBash</h2>


<p>This section goes over Steps 1 and 1.5 of the "Submitting Assignments"
section for Windows users who decide not to use GitBash. This process
involves installing two additional pieces of software, which is why we
recommend using GitBash.</p>


<h3 id="step-1-copying-your-assignment-to-your-class-account">Step 1: Copying your assignment to your class account</h3>


<p>If you decided to use Windows's built-in terminal <code>cmd</code>, the <code>scp</code>
command described earlier in the lab won't be available. Instead,
you'll need to first download a program called
<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>.</p>

<p>After you've installed WinSCP, open it up and configure it so that you
can log in to the server. Here's a screenshot of a typical log in:</p>

<p><img src="assets/WinSCP.png" alt="WinSCIP"></p>

<p>Once you're logged in, all you have to do is navigate to your
<code>cs61a/lab</code> folder on the left and drag your file over to the server on
the right.</p>


<h3 id="step-1-5-logging-into-your-class-account">Step 1.5: Logging into your class account</h3>


<p>In step 1, we used WinSCP to <em>copy files</em> from your personal computer
to your class account. In step 1.5, we will use another program called
PuTTY to <em>log in</em> to your class account. You can download
<a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>.</p>

<p>Take a a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDDaz6Sb8jo">this
