<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>In this lab, you will use a subset of the
<a href="http://www.iula.upf.edu/recurs01_tbk_uk.htm">IULA Spanish LSP Treebank</a>
developed by the <a href="http://www.iula.upf.edu/indexuk.htm">Institut Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada</a>
at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra.</p>

<p>This <em>treebank</em> consists of several sentences from technical documents that
have been annotated with the syntactic category of each word (e.g., <em>noun</em> or
<em>verb</em>), along with all of its syntactic dependents. For instance, in the
sentence "I have a computer," The words "I" and "computer" are dependents of
the verb "have", and "a" is a dependent of the word "computer". Each dependent
has a type, such as <em>subj</em> for the subject of a verb. The exact definition of a
syntactic dependent is debated in linguistics, but a reasonable and consistent
convention was used to annotate this dataset.</p>

<p>The <code>lab13.py</code> file generates a table from the <code>data_spanish.conll</code> text
file, which describes a collection of annotated sentence. You need to run</p>

<pre><code>python3 lab13.py</code></pre>

<p>to generate a single table called <code>deps</code> that has five columns. Each row
describes one dependent of a word in a sentence. The columns are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>word</code> - the base form of a word</li>
  <li><code>category</code> - the syntactic category of a word</li>
  <li><code>dependent_word</code> - the base form of the dependent word</li>
  <li><code>dependent_category</code> - the syntactic category of the dependent word</li>
  <li><code>dependency_type</code> - the type of dependency between the word and its dependent</li>
</ul>

<p>To check that you have successfully created this table, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q generate_table</code></pre>

<p>To use the <code>deps</code> table, first open the <code>spanish.db</code> file from sqlite3. Keep the
sqlite interpreter running to run our examples throughout the lab.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
sqlite&gt; .open spanish.db
sqlite&gt; select word from deps where dependent_word = "caliente";
agua
agua
agua
plato
muestra</code></pre>


<h2 id="exploring-spanish">Exploring Spanish</h2>


<p>Nouns in Spanish are masculine or feminine. Most nouns that end in "a" are
feminine, but some (mostly with Greek origin) are masculine, such as
"<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/problema#Spanish">problema</a>"
(problem) or
"<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sistema#Spanish">sistema</a>" (system).</p>

<p>The articles "el" and "la" both mean "the", but the first is used with
masculine nouns while the second is used with feminine nouns.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>Create a table called <code>masculine_a</code> full of masculine nouns that end in "a".
You can tell if a <code>word</code> ends in "a" using the expression <code>substr(word, -1) =
"a"</code>. You can tell if a <code>word</code> is a masculine noune if "el" is a
<code>dependent_word</code>.</p>


    <button id="0" class="toggleButton">
    Toggle Solution<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
    </button>
    

<pre><code>-- A table containing words that are masculine but end in "a"
CREATE TABLE masculine_a as
<div class="alt 0">    -- REPLACE THIS LINE
    select 'YOUR CODE HERE';
</div><div class="solution 0">    select word from deps where dependent_word = "el" and substr(word, -1) = "a";</div></code></pre>



<p><em>Note</em>: Finding all words ending in "a" that have "el" as a dependent will not
find every masculine noun ending in "a" in Spanish. Also, some nouns that start
with "a", such as "agua", are feminine but nonetheless take "el" as an article.</p>

<p>Check your work before proceeding.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q masculine</code></pre>


<h2 id="sql-aggregation">SQL Aggregation</h2>


<p>Previously, we have been dealing with queries that process one row at a time.
When we join, we make pairwise combinations of all of the rows. When we use
<code>WHERE</code>, we filter out certain rows based on the condition. Alternatively,
applying an <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html">aggregate function</a>
such as <code>MAX(column)</code> combines the values in multiple rows.</p>

<p>By default, all rows are combined together. What if we wanted to group together
the values in similar rows and perform the aggregation operations within those
groups? We use a <code>GROUP BY</code> clause.</p>

<p>Here's an example.
For every unique value in category, collect all the rows having that value into
a group. Then, provide that category and count the number of rows
that have that category. The word
"<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poder#Spanish">poder</a>" is both a noun meaning
"power" and a verb meaning "be able to" do something. We can see that it is
usually a verb.</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT category, count(*) FROM deps where word="poder" GROUP BY category;
NC|26
VMG|2
VMI|1362
VMN|7
VMP|16
VMS|6</code></pre>

<p>Just like how we can filter out rows with <code>WHERE</code>, we can also filter out
groups with <code>HAVING</code>. Important: A <code>HAVING</code> clause should use an aggregate
function. Suppose we want to see all categories with at least 100 rows:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM deps GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 100;
A|5310
CC|3955
CS|526
DA|138
F|166
NC|63980
NP|3076
PI|125
R|536
S|25693
VAI|512
VMG|183
VMI|10291
VMM|207
VMN|2274
VMP|2584
VMS|383
VSI|2978
VSN|178
Z|933</code></pre>

<p>This query discards rare categories such as Demonstrative Determiner ("DD"),
but keeps common ones such as Coordinating Conjunction ("CC").</p>


<h2 id="corpus-statistics">Corpus Statistics</h2>


<p>Please edit <a href="lab13.sql">lab13.sql</a> for the following two questions.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2: Word Category Counts</h3>

<p>Write a query that counts the number of appearances of a particular
word-category pair in the dataset. The new table <code>word_cat_count</code> should have
three columns: <code>word</code>, <code>category</code>, and <code>count</code>.
How should you group the rows together?</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: To group based on information from multiple columns, not just one,
simply add commas between the columns: <code>GROUP BY school, major</code>.</p>


    <button id="1" class="toggleButton">
    Toggle Solution<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
    </button>
    

<pre><code>-- A table containing each word, category, and count of that group
CREATE TABLE word_cat_count AS
<div class="alt 1">    -- REPLACE THIS LINE
    select 'YOUR CODE HERE';
</div><div class="solution 1">    SELECT word, category, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM deps
    GROUP BY word, category;</div></code></pre>



<p>Use OK to test your solution before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q word_cat_count</code></pre>

<p>What are all the rows in <code>word_cat_count</code> involving the word "ser"?</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
sqlite&gt; .read lab13.sql
sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM word_cat_count WHERE word = "ser";
ser|NC|15
ser|VSG|8
ser|VSI|2978
ser|VSN|178
ser|VSP|71
ser|VSS|78</code></pre>

<p>So, "ser" is a verb meaning "to be", e.g. "Soy de California" means "I am from
California." We expect to see a lot of verb (<code>V__</code>) tags in this result.
But wait, there are also cases where "ser" is used as a noun (<code>NC</code>)!
¡Increíble! It turns out that "ser" can also mean "being", for instance
<code>ser humano</code> means "human being".</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3: Noun Verbs</h3>

<p>Write a query that finds all words that can appear as both nouns and verbs.
<em>Hint</em>: Use the <code>word_cat_count</code> table you just wrote.</p>

<p>The resulting rows shoud look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>deber|NC|17|deber|VMG|2</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: No aggregation is required here because we need to compare individual
rows, not aggregate statistics/concatenations of word group.
This question is a review for joins.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Use <code>select *</code> to select all columns from a joined table.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Nouns are always <code>NC</code>, but verbs can be many different categories,
such as "VMI" (main indicative verb) or "VAS" (auxiliary subjunctive verb). To
capture all the possinge strings, use the expression <code>verb LIKE "V__"</code> instead
of <code>verb = "VMI" AND verb = "VMP" AND ...</code>. The underscores match any
character. <code>LIKE</code> is how SQL searches strings, instead of just looking for
exact matches.</p>


    <button id="2" class="toggleButton">
    Toggle Solution<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
    </button>
    

<pre><code>-- A table containing all info of words that can be both nouns and verbs
CREATE TABLE noun_verbs AS
<div class="alt 2">    -- REPLACE THIS LINE
    select 'YOUR CODE HERE';
</div><div class="solution 2">    SELECT * FROM word_cat_count as n, word_cat_count as v
    WHERE n.word = v.word AND n.category == "NC" AND v.category LIKE "V__";</div></code></pre>



<p>Use OK to test your solution before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q noun_verbs</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that <code>haber</code> ("to have (aux)"), like <code>ha comido</code> ("has eaten")
can also appear as a noun!</p>


<h2 id="extra-questions">Extra Questions</h2>


<p>The following questions are for <strong>extra practice</strong> — they can be found
in the <a href="lab13_extra.sql">lab13_extra.sql</a> file. It is recommended that
you complete these problems as well, but you do not need to turn them
in for credit.</p>


<h2 id="dependency-frequencies">Dependency Frequencies</h2>


<p>We are now ready to compute a big frequency table in <a href="lab13_extra.sql">lab13_extra.sql</a>. The code for <code>frequencies</code> is provided for
you. In particular, we group by the word, category, child dependency, and child
category. Why did we consider the child's category in our group? A modifier
can, for instance, be a preposition ("S") or an adjective ("A").</p>

<p>Let's run a few examples with the new <code>frequencies</code> table:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
sqlite&gt; .read lab13_extra.sql
sqlite&gt; -- Example: See what arguments certain verbs take in
sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM frequencies WHERE word = "figurar";
figurar|VMI|MOD|S|1|0.0555555555555556
figurar|VMI|PP-LOC|S|8|0.444444444444444
figurar|VMI|SUBJ|NC|9|0.5
figurar|VMN|MOD|S|1|1.0

sqlite&gt; -- Example: See what deps some words must have. "F" denotes punctuation
sqlite&gt; SELECT word, category, dependency_type, dependent_category, count
   ...&gt; FROM frequencies
   ...&gt; WHERE frequency = 1 AND count &gt; 5 AND dependent_category != "F";
autorizar|VMN|DO|NC|6
auxiliar|VMN|MOD|S|15
capaz|A|COMP|S|6
en_función_de|S|COMP|NC|6
este|DD|SPEC|DI|11
...</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Question 4: The Most Likely Child</h3>

<p>The next natural question to ask is: for a particular word, what kind of
dependent should we expect to see? This question can actually help us identify
certain Spanish constructions (if we're lucky) that are systematically
different from English ones.</p>

<p>Write an appropriate select query for <code>likeliest_child</code>, whose columns are
<code>word</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>dependency_type</code>, <code>dependent_category</code>, and the maximum frequency
for each word-category pair under the column name <code>max_frequency</code>.</p>

<p>Conditions: We want to ignore deps that are just punctuation, so make sure
<code>dependent_category != "F"</code> somewhere in the query.
We also want the maximum frequency found in each word-category pair to be &gt; 0.5
and the total number of the word-category pair occurrences to be &gt; 10.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: To reiterate, we are finding the maximum frequency for each word-category
pair. How will we use <code>GROUP BY</code> to carry out this specific query?</p>

<p><em>Hint2</em>: Which condition applies to each row? Which condition applies to each
group? This then determines which condition(s) to put in <code>WHERE</code> and which to
put in <code>HAVING</code>.</p>


    <button id="3" class="toggleButton">
    Toggle Solution<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
    </button>
    <div class="solution 3">

</div>

<p>Use OK to test your solution:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q likeliest_child</code></pre>

<p>We see a lot of common nouns ("NC") that have an article ("DA"), verbs ("V__")
that take a direct object ("DO"), or prepositions ("S") that have noun
complements. These examples are mostly similar to English. Are there others
that surprise you?</p>

<p>In particular, I saw an interesting example:
<code>
relacionar|VMP|OBLC|S|0.609756097560976
</code></p>

<p>It turns out that <code>relacionado</code> ("related", "VMP" means participle) is used
frequently with an oblique object "OBLC", namely an object denoted by <code>con</code>
("with").</p>

<p>Example: "La supervivencia de el hombre ha estado siempre estrechamente
relacionada con el agua."
Translation: "Human survival has always been closely related to water."</p>

<p>If you come up with other interesting queries, please feel free to post them
on Piazza or discuss with your classmates/lab assistants/TAs!</p>

<p>Fin. (The end.)</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun investigating Spanish, and I hope you did too.
Here are some other extensions you can explore over your summer break:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more practice building SQL tables from Python, you can record all the
  bigrams, trigrams, ..., and n-grams that appear in the corpus. A bigram
  consists of a pair of words that occur next to each other, e.g.
  <code>relacionado con</code>, as you have seen above. We can then see if there are some
  bigrams that occur more frequently than expected.</li>
  <li>If you look at the original CONLL file, you will notice that we have
  mostly ignored morphological features, such as gender/number/person.
  In English, subject-verb agreement is important: The pie is great vs.
  *The pie are great. Spanish has both subject-verb agreement and
  noun-adjective-article agreement. For example, "el" changes to "las"
  for a feminine-plural noun: "las vacaciones". You can actually get a
  computer to logically deduce the agreement through a process called
  <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa12/slides/34-Unification_1pps.pdf">unification</a>.
  Given a problem <code>(el) vacaciones (venir, future tense) pronto</code>, the
  attributes of "vacationes" determine that the sentence should be
  <code>las vacaciones vendrán pronto</code>.</li>
  <li>You can write a program that learns from this hand-annotated training
  data and then try to generate dependencies for a new sentence.</li>
  <li>Another useful data source for Spanish is the EuroParl dataset, which
  aligns translated Spanish sentences with the English transcription of
  the European Parliament proceedings. A very important subproblem for
  translation is the ability to align English phrases to Spanish phrases.
  Example: There are many people everywhere.
  In Spanish: Hay mucha gente por todas partes.
  A program must be able to identify that "There are" matches with "Hay",
  "many people" matches with "mucha gente", and "everywhere" matches with
  "por todas partes".
  Given the English parsing of the NLP lecture and the Spanish dependency
  grammar data here, is there a general way to merge the two systems for
  alignment?</li>
  <li>Of course, Spanish is not the other language out there with interesting
  grammatical properties. You can explore in what ways German word order
  is really precise. Or you can write a program to divide a stream of
  Chinese text into phrases. And more. The internet has a lot of rich data
  sets to process and learn from.</li>
</ul>
