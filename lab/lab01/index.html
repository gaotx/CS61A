<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p><a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">Lab 0</a> walked you through how to use the school computers for CS
61A. This lab explains how to use your own computer to complete
assignments!</p>


<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>



<h3 id="opening-a-terminal">Opening a terminal</h3>


<p>The terminal is a program that allows you to interact with your computer
by entering commands. No matter what operating system you use (Windows,
MacOS, Linux), the terminal will be an essential tool for CS 61A.</p>

<blockquote class="help-mac">

<p>If you're on a Mac or are using a form of Linux (such as Ubuntu), you already
have a program called <code>Terminal</code> on your computer.  Open that up and you should
be good to go.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>For Windows users, we recommend downloading a terminal called <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">GitBash</a>.</p>

</blockquote>


<h3 id="logging-into-your-class-account">Logging into your class account</h3>


<p>At the start of your first lab section, you should have received a
class account form. At the top left of the form should be your
<strong>username</strong> and your temporary <strong>password</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Login: cs61a-aaa
Password: ...</code></pre>

<p>Most of the work in this class can be done without logging into your
account.  However, you will periodically login to your class account to
check your grades.</p>

<p>Let's login in now. Open up your terminal and type in the following
command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh cs61a-??@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code></pre>

<p>where <code>??</code> is replaced with your two (or three) letter login.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're interested, here's an explanation of what the command does:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>ssh</code> is a <strong>s</strong>ecure <strong>sh</strong>ell (i.e. terminal) that connects to remote
  servers</li>
  <li><code>cs61a-??</code> is the username on the remote server</li>
  <li><code>cory.eecs.berkeley.edu</code> is the name of the remote server. Again, here is a
  list of <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/clients.cgi?choice=13&amp;string=">servers</a> that belong to Berkeley's CS department</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>You can also watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irwlU7esODA">video</a> for help.</p>

<p>Once you press enter, the following message will appear:</p>

<pre><code>The authenticity of host 'cory.eecs.berkeley.edu' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</code></pre>

<p>Type in <code>yes</code> and press enter. Next, you will be prompted for your
password. If you haven't changed your password yet, use the temporary
password on your class account form.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you type your password, nothing will show up! This is a security
feature, not a bug. Continue typing and press enter to login.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once you are logged in, you'll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ssh.png" alt="inst login"></p>


<h3 id="registering-your-account">Registering your account</h3>


<p>The first time you login to your class account, your terminal will ask
you some registration questions about the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last name</li>
  <li>First name</li>
  <li>Student ID</li>
  <li>Email (please use your berkeley.edu email!)</li>
  <li>Code name (we don't use this information, you can enter anything you
  want)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>If your terminal doesn't prompt you for this information the first
time you login, you can type <code>register</code> to begin the process. You
don't need to do this again if you've already registered before.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you find errors (e.g. you typed your last name as "ssh update"), fix them
immediately by running the command:</p>

<pre><code>re-register</code></pre>


<h3 id="changing-your-password">Changing your password</h3>


<p>The temporary password is not the easiest thing to remember. While
still logged in, you should change your password by typing in</p>

<pre><code>ssh update</code></pre>

<p>You will be prompted for the temporary password again. After that,
following the instructions for changing your password.</p>


<h3 id="logging-out">Logging out</h3>


<p>Once you've registered your account and changed your password, you can
log out by pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code>.</p>


<h2 id="installing-python">Installing Python</h2>


<p>You can get Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/">here</a>. Download one of the installers (for example,
"Windows x86-64 MSI installer" or "Mac OS X 64-bit installer"). If your computer
is a 64-bit machine, you should download the 64-bit installer. (In general, if
your computer is new within the past 2 years, it is likely 64-bit. Ask a TA or
lab assistant if you're not sure.)</p>

<blockquote class="help-mac">

<p>MacOS users can refer to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHuBHxJdK8">video</a> for additional help on setting
up Python.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble opening the installer, you can right-click the icon and
select "Open".</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>Windows users can refer to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w">video</a> for additional help on
setting up Python (up to 1:09 into the video).</p>

<p>You will also need to configure your <code>PATH</code> environment variable; the same
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w#t=300">video</a> describes how to do this from 5:00 to 5:54.</p>

</blockquote>


<h2 id="organizing-your-files">Organizing your files</h2>


<p>First, open up a terminal, if you haven't already. Since we're learning
how to work on your personal computer, make sure you are <strong>not</strong> logged
in to your class account.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/terminal (1).png" alt="starting the terminal"></p>

<p>Right now, I'm in my home directory. The <strong>home directory</strong> is represented
by the <code>~</code> symbol. When you first open your terminal, you will start in
the home directory.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don't worry if your terminal window doesn't look exactly the
same; the important part is that the text on the left hand side is
relatively the same (with a different name) and you should definitely
see a <code>~</code> (tilde).</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="directories">Directories</h3>


<p>Throughout this lab, we will be using terminal commands (like in <a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">lab
0</a>) to manage our files. The first command we'll use is <code>ls</code> (the
letter <code>l</code> and the letter <code>s</code>). Try typing it in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>ls</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ls</code> command <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ts all the files and folders in the current
directory. A <strong>directory</strong> is another name for a folder (such as the
<code>Documents</code> folder). Since we're in the home directory right now, you
should see the contents of your home directory.</p>


<h3 id="making-new-directories">Making New Directories</h3>


<p>Our next command is called <code>mkdir</code>, which <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>es new
<strong>dir</strong>ectories. Let's make a directory called <code>cs61a</code> to store all of
the assignments for this class:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir cs61a</code></pre>

<p>A folder called <code>cs61a</code> will appear in our home directory.</p>


<h3 id="moving-to-other-directories">Moving to other directories</h3>


<p>To move into another directory, we use the <code>cd</code> command. Try typing the
following command into your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>cd cs61a</code></pre>

<p>The <code>cd</code> command will <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectories â€” in other words, it
moves you into the specified folder. In the example above, we chose to
move into the <code>cs61a</code> directory.</p>

<p>If we want to go back to our home directory, there are a few ways to do
so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type <code>cd ..</code> (two dots). The <code>..</code> means "the parent directory". In
  this case, the parent directory of <code>lab0</code> happens to be our home
  directory, so we can use <code>cd ..</code> to go up one directory.</li>
  <li>Type <code>cd ~</code> (the tilde). Remember that <code>~</code> means home directory, so
  this command tells your terminal to change to the home directory,
  no matter where you currently are.</li>
  <li>Type <code>cd</code> (that is, the <code>cd</code> command with no arguments). In UNIX,
  typing just <code>cd</code> is a shortcut for typing <code>cd ~</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, let's create some more directories. Make sure you are in
the <code>~/cs61a</code> directory, using the necessary <code>cd</code> commands. Then create
<code>projects</code>, <code>lab</code>, and <code>lab01</code> folders inside of our <code>lab</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/cs61a
mkdir projects
mkdir lab
mkdir lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>Now if we list the contents of the directory (using <code>ls</code>), we'll see two
folders, <code>projects</code> and <code>lab</code>.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/terminal_commands.png" alt="cs61a directory"></p>


<h3 id="downloading-the-assignment">Downloading the assignment</h3>


<p>Next, download the template file for this lab, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/lab/lab01/lab01.py">lab01.py</a>. Once
you've done that, let's find our downloaded file.  On most computers,
<code>lab01.py</code> is probably located in a directory called <code>Downloads</code> in
your home directory. Let's use the <code>ls</code> command to check:</p>

<pre><code>ls ~/Downloads</code></pre>

<p>If you don't see <code>lab01.py</code>, ask a TA or lab assistant for help.</p>


<h3 id="moving-files">Moving files</h3>


<p>Let's move our starter file into our new lab directory. From the
terminal use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mv ~/Downloads/lab01.py ~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mv</code> command will <strong>m</strong>o<strong>v</strong>e the file located at
<code>~/Downloads/lab01.py</code> to the directory <code>~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code>.</p>

<p>Now, go back into the <code>lab01</code> folder that we made earlier.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/cs61a/lab/lab01</code></pre>

<p>We're ready to start editing a file. Don't worry if this seems
complicated â€” it will get much easier over time.  Just keep
practicing! You can also take a look at <a href="../lab00/" title="Lab 0">Lab 0</a> for a more detailed
explanation of terminal commands.</p>


<h2 id="installing-a-text-editor">Installing a text editor</h2>


<p>The <strong>Python interpreter</strong> that you installed earlier allows you to <em>run</em> Python
code. You will also need a <strong>text editor</strong>, which will help you <em>write</em> Python
code.</p>

<p>A text editor is similar to Microsoft Word â€” a program that allows you to write
in one or more languages. You will be using a text editor to create, modify, and
save files.</p>

<p>There are many editors out there, each with its own set of features.  You can
choose your own editor, but for the purpose of this class, your text editor must</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an easy way to open and edit new files</li>
  <li>Work well with Python files and plain text in general</li>
  <li>Have line numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, almost all useful editors have</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the text editors that we recommend. We've written short guides for each
one to get you started:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../sublime/">Sublime Text</a> (a popular choice among students)</li>
  <li><a href="../emacs/">Emacs</a></li>
  <li><a href="../vim/">Vim</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each guide has a section on installing the text editor to your personal
computer. For the sake of this lab, you can just jump to there, but come back to
finish up the lab!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please, please, <em>please</em> do not use Microsoft Word to edit
programs. Word is designed to edit natural languages like English â€” trouble
will ensue if you try to write Python with Word!</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Python usually comes with a text editor called IDLE. We <strong>do not</strong>
recommend it because you won't gain as much experience using the command line
to run your Python programs. This is very important once you start working on
the projects for this class so we highly recommend that you use the command
line to run your files from day 1!</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="a-first-look-at-lab01-py">A first look at <code>lab01.py</code></h2>


<p>Notice the various blocks of yellow text that are wrapped within three quotation
marks <code>"""</code>. That text is called a <strong>docstring</strong>, which is a description of what
the function is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Within the docstring, there are lines that begin with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. These lines are
called <strong>doctests</strong>. Doctests are a great way to explain what the function does
by showing actual Python code: "if we input this Python code (the lines that say
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), what should the expected output be (the lines underneath the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>)?"</p>

<p>In particular, let's look at the <code>my_email()</code> function:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/email.png" alt="<code>my_name</code> function"></p>

<p>The doctest checks that you changed the return value (<code>return ...</code>) from the
default <code>'oski@berkeley.edu'</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: You should never change the doctests in your assignments!  The only
part of your assignments that you'll need to edit is the code.</p></blockquote>

<p>How do we use these tests? Glad you asked!</p>


<h2 id="running-doctests">Running doctests</h2>


<p>To run our doctests, switch over to our terminal and type in the following
command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>

<blockquote class="help-windows">

<p>If you are using Windows and the <code>python3</code> command doesn't work, try using just
<code>python</code> or <code>py</code>. If neither of those work, take another look at the video in
the section on <a href="#installing-python">installing Python</a> to make sure you are
setting up your PATH correctly. Ask a TA or lab assistant for help if you get
stuck!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This will print out a lot of output that shows which tests we are currently
failing. You should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/doctests.png" alt="doctest output"></p>

<p>Oh man, we had 2 failures! :( Before we begin fixing our bugs, let's see what
this output says. In particular, look at the <code>my_email</code> test that we failed:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/email_failure.png" alt="my name test failure"></p>

<p>Notice it says we had an error in <code>lab01.py</code> on line 4, in the function
<code>my_email</code>. Now we know exactly where to look for the bug!  (This is why line
numbers are a must for text editors.)</p>

<p>After we find line 4, let's try to understand what the test is saying: the
function <code>my_email</code>, when called with zero inputs, should <strong>not</strong> return the
string <code>'oski@berkeley.edu'</code>. The problem is, ours is returning that string!
Change that to your berkeley.edu email:</p>

<pre><code>def my_email():
    """Return your last name as a string.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_email() != 'oski@berkeley.edu'
    True
    """
    return 'jane.doe@berkeley.edu'</code></pre>

<p>Once you've changed the return value of the function <code>my_email</code> (make sure that
you're returning a string, which has quotes around it), try running the doctests
again from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>

<p>The test for <code>my_email</code> should pass. One down, one to go!</p>

<p>For the second function, <code>twenty_fifteen</code>, replace the blank line with an
expression that evaluates to the number 2015, using only integers and the
functions <code>add</code> and <code>mul</code>. There are many simple ways to do this â€” try to come
up with the most creative solution! Make sure your doctests pass once you're
done.</p>

<blockquote><p>You might run your doctests and see that there is no output. This is actually
good â€” it means all the tests passed. By default, doctests only print output
when you have <strong>failures</strong> in your tests.</p>

<p>However, if you want to double-check that you are passing all of the tests,
you can add a command line flag <code>-v</code> to see <em>all</em> the output, including the
tests that passed:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m doctest -v lab01.py</code></pre>

<p>This is called "verbose" mode.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once all of your tests pass, the verbose output of the doctests (<code>python3 -m
doctest -v lab01.py</code>) should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/passed_tests.png" alt="successful"></p>
