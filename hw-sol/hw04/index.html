<p><strong>Acknowledgements.</strong> This interval arithmetic example is based on
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a system to help people
solve engineering problems. One feature she wants to provide in her
system is the ability to manipulate inexact quantities (such as
measured parameters of physical devices) with known precision, so that
when computations are done with such approximate quantities the results
will be numbers of known precision.</p>

<p>Alyssa's idea is to implement interval arithmetic as a set of
arithmetic operations for combining "intervals" (objects that represent
the range of possible values of an inexact quantity). The result of
adding, subracting, multiplying, or dividing two intervals is itself an
interval, representing the range of the result.</p>

<p>Alyssa postulates the existence of an abstract object called an
"interval" that has two endpoints: a lower bound and an upper bound.
She also presumes that, given the endpoints of an interval, she can
construct the interval using the data constructor interval.   Using the
constructor and selectors, she defines the following operations:</p>

<pre><code>def str_interval(x):
    """Return a string representation of interval x.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; str_interval(interval(-1, 2))
    '-1 to 2'
    """
    return '{0} to {1}'.format(lower_bound(x), upper_bound(x))

def add_interval(x, y):
    """Return an interval that contains the sum of any value in interval x and
    any value in interval y.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; str_interval(add_interval(interval(-1, 2), interval(4, 8)))
    '3 to 10'
    """
    lower = lower_bound(x) + lower_bound(y)
    upper = upper_bound(x) + upper_bound(y)
    return interval(lower, upper)

def mul_interval(x, y):
    """Return the interval that contains the product of any value in x and any
    value in y.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; str_interval(mul_interval(interval(-1, 2), interval(4, 8)))
    '-8 to 16'
    """
    p1 = lower_bound(x) * lower_bound(y)
    p2 = lower_bound(x) * upper_bound(y)
    p3 = upper_bound(x) * lower_bound(y)
    p4 = upper_bound(x) * upper_bound(y)
    return interval(min(p1, p2, p3, p4), max(p1, p2, p3, p4))</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>Alyssa's program is incomplete because she has not specified the
implementation of the interval abstraction. Define the constructor and
selectors in terms of two-element lists:</p>

<pre><code>def interval(a, b):
    """Construct an interval from a to b."""
<span class="sol-highlight">    return [a, b]</span>

def lower_bound(x):
    """Return the lower bound of interval x."""
<span class="sol-highlight">    return x[0]</span>

def upper_bound(x):
    """Return the upper bound of interval x."""
<span class="sol-highlight">    return x[1]</span></code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p>Alyssa implements division below, by multiplying by the reciprocal of
<code>y</code>. Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer, looks over Alyssa's
shoulder and comments that it is not clear what it means to divide by
an interval that spans zero. Add an assert statement to Alyssa's code
to ensure that no such interval is used as a divisor:</p>

<pre><code>def div_interval(x, y):
    """Return the interval that contains the quotient of any value in x divided
    by any value in y.

    Division is implemented as the multiplication of x by the reciprocal of y.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; str_interval(div_interval(interval(-1, 2), interval(4, 8)))
    '-0.25 to 0.5'
    """
<span class="sol-highlight">    assert lower_bound(y) &gt; 0 or upper_bound(y) &lt; 0, 'Divide by zero'</span>
    reciprocal_y = interval(1/upper_bound(y), 1/lower_bound(y))
    return mul_interval(x, reciprocal_y)</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3</h3>

<p>Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa's, define a subtraction function
for intervals:</p>

<pre><code>def sub_interval(x, y):
    """Return the interval that contains the difference between any value in x
    and any value in y.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; str_interval(sub_interval(interval(-1, 2), interval(4, 8)))
    '-9 to -2'
    """
<span class="sol-highlight">    negative_y = interval(-upper_bound(y), -lower_bound(y))
    return add_interval(x, negative_y)</span></code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Question 4</h3>

<p>After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished system.
Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets a
frenzied call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit. It seems that Lem has
noticed that the formula for parallel resistors can be written in two
algebraically equivalent ways:</p>

<pre><code>par1(r1, r2) = (r1 * r2) / (r1 + r2)</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>par2(r1, r2) = 1 / (1/r1 + 1/r2)</code></pre>

<p>He has written the following two programs, each of which computes the
<code>parallel_resistors</code> formula differently::</p>

<pre><code>def par1(r1, r2):
    return div_interval(mul_interval(r1, r2), add_interval(r1, r2))

def par2(r1, r2):
    one = interval(1, 1)
    rep_r1 = div_interval(one, r1)
    rep_r2 = div_interval(one, r2)
    return div_interval(one, add_interval(rep_r1, rep_r2))</code></pre>

<p>Lem complains that Alyssa's program gives different answers for the two
ways of computing. This is a serious complaint.</p>

<p>Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system
on a variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code>, and show that <code>par1</code> and <code>par2</code> can give different results. You
will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small
percentage of the center value:</p>

<pre><code># These two intervals give different results for parallel resistors:
<span class="sol-highlight">a = make_center_percent(1, 1)
b = make_center_percent(2, 1)
print(str_interval(par1(a, b)), '!=', str_interval(par2(a, b)))</span></code></pre>

be accepted, but please attempt to answer the question correctly.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q5">Question 5</h3>

<p>Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals
computed by different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She
says that the problem is multiple references to the same interval.</p>

<p>The Multiple References Problem: a formula to compute with intervals
using Alyssa's system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be
written in such a form that no variable that represents an uncertain
number is repeated.</p>

<p>Thus, she says, <code>par2</code> is a better program for parallel resistances
than <code>par1</code>. Is she right? Why? Write a function that returns a string
containing a written explanation of your answer:</p>

<pre><code>def multiple_references_explanation():
<span class="sol-highlight">    return """The multiple reference problem exists.  The true value
    within a particular interval is fixed (though unknown).  Nested
    combinations that refer to the same interval twice may assume two different
    true values for the same interval, which is an error that results in
    intervals that are larger than they should be.

    Consider the case of i * i, where i is an interval from -1 to 1.  No value
    within this interval, when squared, will give a negative result.  However,
    our mul_interval function will allow us to choose 1 from the first
    reference to i and -1 from the second, giving an erroneous lower bound of
    -1.

    Hence, a program like par2 is better than par1 because it never combines
    the same interval more than once.
    """</span></code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: No tests will be run on your solution to this problem. Any answer will
be accepted, but please attempt to answer the question correctly.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q6">Question 6</h3>

<p>Write a function <code>quadratic</code> that returns the interval of all values
<code>f(t)</code> such that <code>t</code> is in the argument interval <code>x</code> and <code>f(t)</code> is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function">quadratic function</a>:</p>

<pre><code>f(t) = a*t*t + b*t + c</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that your implementation returns the smallest such interval,
one that does not suffer from the multiple references problem.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: the derivative <code>f'(t) = 2*a*t + b</code>, and so the extreme
point of the quadratic is <code>-b/(2*a)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def quadratic(x, a, b, c):
    """Return the interval that is the range of the quadratic defined by
    coefficients a, b, and c, for domain interval x.

<h3 class="question" id="q7">Question 7: Challenge Problem (optional)</h3>

<p>Write a function polynomial that takes an interval <code>x</code> and a list of
coefficients <code>c</code>, and returns the interval containing all values of
<code>f(t)</code> for <code>t</code> in interval <code>x</code>, where:</p>

<pre><code>f(t) = c[k-1] * pow(t, k-1) + c[k-2] * pow(t, k-2) + ... + c[0] * 1</code></pre>

such interval, one that does not suffer from the multiple references
problem.</p>
