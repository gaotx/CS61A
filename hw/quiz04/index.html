    <h1 id="title-main">CS 61A: Quiz 4</h1>

    <p><em>Due by 11:59pm on Thursday, 4/30</em></p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Download <a href="quiz04.zip">quiz04.zip</a>.  Inside the archive, you
will find a file called <a href="quiz04.sql">quiz04.sql</a>, along with a copy of the <a href="ok">OK</a> autograder.</p>

<p>Complete the quiz and submit it before 11:59pm on Thursday, 4/30. <strong>You must
work alone</strong>, but you may talk to the course staff (see <strong>Asking
Questions</strong> below). You may use any course materials, including an
interpreter, course videos, slides, and readings. Please <strong>do
not</strong> discuss these specific questions with your classmates, and
<strong>do not</strong> scour the web for answers or post your answers
online.</p>

<p>Your submission will be graded automatically for correctness. Your
implementations <strong>do not</strong> need to be efficient, as long as they
are correct. We will apply additional correctness tests as well as the ones
provided. Passing these tests does not guarantee a perfect score.</p>

<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong> If you believe you need clarification on
a question, <strong>make a private post</strong> on Piazza.  Please do not post
publicly about the quiz contents.  If the staff discovers a problem with the
quiz or needs to clarify a question, we will email the class via Piazza. You
can also come to office hours to ask questions about the quiz or any other
course material, but no answers or hints will be provided in office hours.</p>

<p><strong>Submission:</strong> When you are done, submit with
<code>python3 ok --submit</code>. You may submit more than once before
the deadline; only the final submission will be scored.</p>

<h2>Using OK</h2>

<p>The <code>ok</code> program helps you test your code and track your progress.
The first time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your
@berkeley.edu account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run
ok, it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

You can run all the doctests with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>To test a specific question, use the <code>-q</code> option with the
name of the function:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q &lt;function&gt;</code></pre>

<p>By default, only tests that <strong>fail</strong> will appear. If you
want to see how you did on all tests, you can use the <code>-v</code>
option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -v</code></pre>

<p>If you do not want to send your progress to our server or you have any
problems logging in, add the <code>--local</code> flag to block all
communication:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --local</code></pre>

<p>When you are ready to submit, run <code>ok</code> with the
<code>--submit</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>


<p>To complete this quiz, you will need to use Sqlite version 3.8.3 or greater.
See <a href="http://cs61a.org/lab/lab12">Lab 12</a> for setup and usage instructions.</p>

<p>To check your progress, you can run <code>sqlite3</code> directly by running:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql</code></pre>

<p>You should also check your work using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>If OK is not able to use <code>sqlite3</code> to verify your work directly, it
will at least show you the output of the test cases, like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>size &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1

Unfortunately, OK is unable to use sqlite3 to test your code directly.
Here is a transcript of what your code does in the sqlite3 interpreter.

TEST:
    .read quiz04.sql
    select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;
EXPECTED (order does not matter):
    5
    7
    9
    10
OUTPUT:
    5
    7
    9
    10

Please manually check if your solution's output is correct.</code></pre>

<p>As long as the displayed <code>OUTPUT</code> matches the <code>EXPECTED</code> output, your
solution will be considered correct (even though OK will report a test
failure).</p>


<h3 id="data">Data</h3>


<p>A block of 10 store locations, numbered 1 through 10, already has some cafes.
Cafes can serve espresso, bagels, coffee, muffins, and eggs (but nothing else).</p>

<pre><code>-- Locations of each cafe
create table cafes as
  select "nefeli" as name, 2 as location union
  select "brewed"        , 8             union
  select "hummingbird"   , 6;

-- Menu items at each cafe
create table menus as
  select "nefeli" as cafe, "espresso" as item union
  select "nefeli"        , "bagels"           union
  select "brewed"        , "coffee"           union
  select "brewed"        , "bagels"           union
  select "brewed"        , "muffins"          union
  select "hummingbird"   , "muffins"          union
  select "hummingbird"   , "eggs";

-- All locations on the block
create table locations as
  with locations(n) as (
    select 1 union
    select n+1 from locations where n &lt; 10
  )
  select * from locations;</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>You would like to open a new cafe. Create a table <code>open_locations</code> that
has a single column <code>n</code> where each row is a location that is not already
occupied by an existing cafe.</p>

<pre><code>-- Locations without a cafe
create table open_locations as
  select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

-- select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5
--   7
--   9
--   10</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Join <code>locations</code> and <code>cafes</code> in the <code>from</code> clause, so that you can
compare a location <code>n</code> with the <code>location</code> of an existing cafe.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: A location is open if its minimum distance from an existing cafe is
more than 0. The built-in <code>abs</code> and <code>min</code> functions can be used to express
this condition in a <code>having</code> clause.</p>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q open</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p>To limit competition, the block mandates that no cafe can have a menu item
that is sold by another cafe within 2 locations. So, if location 2 already
sells bagels, then a cafe located at 1, 3, or 4 cannot sell bagels. You may
assume that every item is sold by at least one cafe.</p>

<p>Create a table <code>allowed</code> that has two columns, a location <code>n</code> and a menu
<code>item</code>. The rows should contain every item that can be sold at every
location, based on these constraints. It should include occupied
locations that could expand their current menus.</p>

<pre><code>-- Items that could be placed on a menu at an open location
create table allowed as
  with item_locations(item, location) as (
    select item, location from cafes, menus where name = cafe
  )
  select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

-- select * from allowed where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5|bagels
--   5|coffee
--   5|espresso
--   6|espresso
--   7|espresso
--   8|espresso
--   9|eggs
--   9|espresso
--   10|eggs
--   10|espresso</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Join <code>locations</code> and <code>item_locations</code>, so that you can compare how
far a location <code>n</code> is from the <code>location</code> at which an item is already sold.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Group by a combination of the location <code>n</code> and the <code>item</code> that might
be sold at <code>n</code>; use a <code>having</code> clause to filter the groups.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: You <strong>do not</strong> need to use <code>open_locations</code> from the previous question.</p>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select * from allowed where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q allowed</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3: Challenge Problem (optional)</h3>

<p><strong>This question is optional and ungraded. It is strongly recommended for
practice! You will need to answer the previous two questions successfully to
answer this question.</strong></p>

<p>You decide you will sell as many menu items as possible in your new location.
Create a table <code>full</code> that has three columns, an open location <code>n</code>, a
comma-separated list of <code>items</code> that you would sell, and the length of that
list. The <code>items</code> should be in alphabetical order, and only the longest
possible list of <code>items</code> for each <code>location</code> should appear as a row.</p>

<pre><code>-- Open locations and their maximum-length menus
create table full as
  select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

-- select n, items from full where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5|bagels, coffee, espresso
--   7|espresso
--   9|eggs, espresso
--   10|eggs, espresso</code></pre>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select n, items from full where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q full</code></pre>
