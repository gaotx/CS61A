    <h1 id="title-main">CS 61A: Quiz 3</h1>

    <p><em>Due by 11:59pm on Thursday, 4/9</em></p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Download <a href="quiz03.zip">quiz03.zip</a>.  Inside the archive, you
will find a file called <a href="quiz03.scm">quiz03.scm</a>, along with a copy of the <a href="ok">OK</a> autograder.</p>

<p>Complete the quiz and submit it before 11:59pm on Thursday, 4/9. <strong>You must
work alone</strong>, but you may talk to the course staff (see <strong>Asking
Questions</strong> below). You may use any course materials, including an
interpreter, course videos, slides, and readings. Please <strong>do
not</strong> discuss these specific questions with your classmates, and
<strong>do not</strong> scour the web for answers or post your answers
online.</p>

<p>Your submission will be graded automatically for correctness. Your
implementations <strong>do not</strong> need to be efficient, as long as they
are correct. We will apply additional correctness tests as well as the ones
provided. Passing these tests does not guarantee a perfect score.</p>

<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong> If you believe you need clarification on
a question, <strong>make a private post</strong> on Piazza.  Please do not post
publicly about the quiz contents.  If the staff discovers a problem with the
quiz or needs to clarify a question, we will email the class via Piazza. You
can also come to office hours to ask questions about the quiz or any other
course material, but no answers or hints will be provided in office hours.</p>

<p><strong>Submission:</strong> When you are done, submit with
<code>python3 ok --submit</code>. You may submit more than once before
the deadline; only the final submission will be scored.</p>

<h2>Using OK</h2>

<p>The <code>ok</code> program helps you test your code and track your progress.
The first time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your
@berkeley.edu account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run
ok, it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

You can run all the doctests with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>To test a specific question, use the <code>-q</code> option with the
name of the function:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q &lt;function&gt;</code></pre>

<p>By default, only tests that <strong>fail</strong> will appear. If you
want to see how you did on all tests, you can use the <code>-v</code>
option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -v</code></pre>

<p>If you do not want to send your progress to our server or you have any
problems logging in, add the <code>--local</code> flag to block all
communication:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --local</code></pre>

<p>When you are ready to submit, run <code>ok</code> with the
<code>--submit</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>The Scheme interpreter is included in the starter ZIP archive. To run the
Scheme interpreter, use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme</code></pre>

<p>To load a file (such as <code>quiz03.scm</code>), use</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme -load quiz03.scm</code></pre>

<p>You can also use our
<a href="http://cs61a.org/assets/interpreter/scheme.html">online Scheme interpreter</a>.</p>

<p>You may use the <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> procedures defined below in your solutions.</p>

<pre><code>(define (map f s)
  ; List the result of applying f to each element in s.
  (if (null? s) s
    (cons (f (car s)) (map f (cdr s)))))

(define (filter f s)
  ; List the elements of s for which f returns a true value.
  (if (null? s) s
    (let ((rest (filter f (cdr s))))
      (if (f (car s)) (cons (car s) rest) rest))))</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>Implement <code>no-repeats</code>, which takes a list of numbers <code>s</code> as input and returns
a list that has all of the unique elements of <code>s</code> in the order that they first
appear, but no repeats. For example, <code>(no-repeats (list 5 4 5 4 2 2))</code>
evaluates to <code>(5 4 2)</code>.</p>

<p><em>Hints</em>: To test if two numbers are equal, use the <code>=</code> procedure. To test if
two numbers are not equal, use the <code>not</code> procedure in combination with <code>=</code>.</p>

<pre><code>(define (no-repeats s)
  ; YOUR-CODE-HERE
  'replace-this)</code></pre>

<p>For more examples, unlock the tests associated with this question.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q no-repeats -u</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p>Implement <code>how-many-dots</code>, which takes in a nested scheme list <code>s</code> and returns
the number of dots that appear when it is displayed by the interpreter (not
counting decimal points). You may assume that <code>s</code> is a nested list that
contains only numbers.</p>

<p><em>Hints</em>: A dot appears when the second element of a pair is not a well formed
list. The procedures <code>pair?</code>, <code>null?</code>, and <code>number?</code> test whether a value is a pair, <code>nil</code>, or a number, respectively.</p>

<pre><code>(define (how-many-dots s)
  ; YOUR-CODE-HERE
  'replace-this)</code></pre>

<p>For more examples, unlock the tests associated with this question.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q how-many-dots -u</code></pre>
