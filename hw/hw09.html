    <h1 id="title-main">CS 61A: Homework 9</h1>

    <p><em>Due by 11:59pm on Wednesday, 4/29</em></p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Download <a href="hw09.zip">hw09.zip</a>.  Inside the archive, you
will find a file called <a href="hw09.sql">hw09.sql</a>, along with a copy of the <a href="ok">OK</a> autograder.</p>



<p><strong>Submission:</strong> When you are done, submit with
<code>python3 ok --submit</code>. You may submit more than once before
the deadline; only the final submission will be scored.</p>

<h2>Using OK</h2>

<p>The <code>ok</code> program helps you test your code and track your progress.
The first time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your
@berkeley.edu account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run
ok, it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

You can run all the doctests with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>To test a specific question, use the <code>-q</code> option with the
name of the function:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q &lt;function&gt;</code></pre>

<p>By default, only tests that <strong>fail</strong> will appear. If you
want to see how you did on all tests, you can use the <code>-v</code>
option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -v</code></pre>

<p>If you do not want to send your progress to our server or you have any
problems logging in, add the <code>--local</code> flag to block all
communication:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --local</code></pre>

<p>When you are ready to submit, run <code>ok</code> with the
<code>--submit</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>To complete this homework assignment, you will need to use Sqlite version
3.8.3 or greater. See <a href="http://cs61a.org/lab/lab12">Lab 12</a> for setup and usage instructions.</p>

<p>To check your progress, you can run <code>sqlite3</code> directly by running:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 -init hw09.sql</code></pre>

<p>You should also check your work using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>If OK is not able to use <code>sqlite3</code> to verify your work directly, OK
will at least show you the output of the test cases, like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>size &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1

Unfortunately, OK is unable to use sqlite3 to test your code directly.
Here is a transcript of what your code does in the sqlite3 interpreter.

TEST:
    .read hw09.sql
    select name from size_of_dogs where size="toy" or size="mini";
EXPECTED (order does not matter):
    abraham
    eisenhower
    fillmore
    grover
    herbert
OUTPUT:

Please manually check if your solution's output is correct.</code></pre>

<p>As long as the displayed <code>OUTPUT</code> matches the <code>EXPECTED</code> output, your
solution will be considered correct (even though OK will report a test
failure).</p>


<h3 id="data">Data</h3>


<p>In each question below, you will define a new table based on the following
tables.</p>

<pre><code>create table parents as
  select "abraham" as parent, "barack" as child union
  select "abraham"          , "clinton"         union
  select "delano"           , "herbert"         union
  select "fillmore"         , "abraham"         union
  select "fillmore"         , "delano"          union
  select "fillmore"         , "grover"          union
  select "eisenhower"       , "fillmore";

create table dogs as
  select "abraham" as name, "long" as fur, 26 as height union
  select "barack"         , "short"      , 52           union
  select "clinton"        , "long"       , 47           union
  select "delano"         , "long"       , 46           union
  select "eisenhower"     , "short"      , 35           union
  select "fillmore"       , "curly"      , 32           union
  select "grover"         , "short"      , 28           union
  select "herbert"        , "curly"      , 31;

create table sizes as
  select "toy" as size, 24 as min, 28 as max union
  select "mini",        28,        35        union
  select "medium",      35,        45        union
  select "standard",    45,        60;</code></pre>

<p>Your tables should still perform correctly even if the values in these tables
change. For example, if you are asked to list all dogs with a name that starts
with h, you should write:</p>

<pre><code>select name from dogs where "h" &lt;= name and name &lt; "i";</code></pre>

<p>Instead of assuming that the <code>dogs</code> table has only the data above and writing</p>

<pre><code>select "herbert";</code></pre>

<p>The former query would still be correct if the name <code>grover</code> were changed to
<code>hoover</code> or a row was added with the name <code>harry</code>.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale classifies a standard poodle as over
45 cm and up to 60 cm. The <code>sizes</code> table describes this and other such
classifications, where a dog must be over the <code>min</code> and less than or equal to
the <code>max</code> in height to qualify as a <code>size</code>.

<p>Create a <code>size_of_dogs</code> table with two columns, one for each dog's <code>name</code> and
another for its <code>size</code>.</p>

<pre><code>-- The size of each dog
create table size_of_dogs as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

-- Example:
select name from size_of_dogs where size="toy" or size="mini";
-- Expected output:
--   abraham
--   eisenhower
--   fillmore
--   grover
--   herbert</code></pre>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q small</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>
Create a table <code>by_height</code> that has a column of the names of all dogs that have
a <code>parent</code>, ordered by the height of the parent from tallest parent to shortest
parent.

<pre><code>-- All dogs with parents ordered by decreasing height of their parent
create table by_height as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";</code></pre>

<p>For example, <code>fillmore</code> has a parent (<code>eisenhower</code>) with height 35, and so
should appear before <code>grover</code> who has a parent (<code>fillmore</code>) with height 32.
The names of dogs with parents of the same height should appear together in any
order. For example, <code>barack</code> and <code>clinton</code> should both appear at the end, but
either one can come before the other.</p>

<pre><code>-- Example:
select * from by_height;
-- Expected output:
--   herbert
--   fillmore
--   abraham
--   delano
--   grover
--   barack
--   clinton</code></pre>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q parent-height</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3</h3>
Create a single string for every pair of siblings that have the same size.
Each value should be a sentence describing the siblings by their size, as shown
in the expected output below.

<pre><code>-- Sentences about siblings that are the same size
create table sentences as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";</code></pre>

<p>Each sibling pair should appear only once in alphabetical order.</p>

<pre><code>-- Example:
select * from sentences;
-- Expected output:
--   barack and clinton are standard siblings
--   abraham and grover are toy siblings</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: First use a <code>with</code> clause to create a local table of siblings.
Comparing the size of siblings will be simplified.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: If you join a table with itself, use <code>as</code> within the <code>from</code> clause to
give each table an alias.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: In order to concatenate two strings into one, use the <code>||</code> operator.</p>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q size-siblings</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Question 4</h3>
When dogs are stacked on top of one another, the total height of the stack is
the sum of the heights of the dogs.

<p>Create a two-column table describing all stacks of dogs at least 170 cm high.
The first column should contains a comma-separated list of dogs in the stack,
and the second column should contain the total height of the stack. Order the
stacks in increasing order of total height.</p>

<pre><code>-- Ways to stack 4 dogs to a height of at least 170, ordered by total height
create table stacks as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";</code></pre>

<p>A valid stack of dogs includes each dog only once, and the dogs should be
listed in increasing order of height within the stack.
<strong>Assume that no two dogs have the same height</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>-- Example:
select * from stacks;
-- Expected output:
--   abraham, delano, clinton, barack|171
--   grover, delano, clinton, barack|173
--   herbert, delano, clinton, barack|176
--   fillmore, delano, clinton, barack|177
--   eisenhower, delano, clinton, barack|180</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Use a <code>with</code> clause to create a recursive table with additional
columns, such as the number of dogs that have been stacked and information
about the last dog added (to control the dog order). Then, select the
rows and columns from this larger table to generate the final solution.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Use height comparisons to ensure that dogs are not repeated in a stack.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Generating the comma-separated list of dogs is easier if your base
case includes the name of one dog without any commas before or after it,
rather than no dogs at all.</p>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q stack</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q5">Question 5</h3>

<p>Create a table <code>tallest</code> that includes the <code>height</code> and <code>name</code> of every dog
that shares the 10's digit of its <code>height</code> with at least one other dog and has
the highest 1's digit of all dogs that have the same 10's digit.</p>

<pre><code>create table tallest as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

-- Example:
select * from tallest;
-- Expected output:
--   28|grover
--   35|eisenhower
--   47|clinton</code></pre>

<p><em>Explanation</em>: <code>grover</code> is the tallest 20-something dog. <code>eisenhower</code> is the
tallest 30-something dog. <code>clinton</code> is the tallest 40-something dog. <code>barack</code>
is not included because there are no other 50-something dogs.</p>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q tallest</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q6">Question 6</h3>

<p><strong>This question is optional but recommended for practice. You can
receive full credit for the homework without attempting this problem.</strong></p>

<p>A non-parent relation is either an ancestor that is not a parent (such as a
grandparent or great-grandparent) or a descendent that is not a child (such
as a grandchild or great-grandchild). Siblings are <em>not</em> relations under this
definition.</p>

<p>Select all pairs that form non-parent relations ordered by the difference in
height between one dog and the other.</p>

<pre><code>-- All non-parent relations ordered by height difference
create table non_parents as
select "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";</code></pre>

<p>The shortest paired with the tallest should appear first, and the tallest
paired with the shortest should appear last. If two pairs have the same height
difference, they may appear together in any order.</p>

<pre><code>-- Example:
select * from non_parents;
-- Expected output:
--   fillmore|barack
--   eisenhower|barack
--   fillmore|clinton
--   eisenhower|clinton
--   eisenhower|delano
--   abraham|eisenhower
--   grover|eisenhower
--   herbert|eisenhower
--   herbert|fillmore
--   fillmore|herbert
--   eisenhower|herbert
--   eisenhower|grover
--   eisenhower|abraham
--   delano|eisenhower
--   clinton|eisenhower
--   clinton|fillmore
--   barack|eisenhower
--   barack|fillmore</code></pre>

<p>Test your solution with OK:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q relations</code></pre>
